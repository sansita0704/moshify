        • Media Component or Media Object:
        - It is a component containing an image or an icon on the left side and a heading and some text on the right side.

        • Color Palette
        - It contains primary, secondary, accent and other colours.

        - Inter is a variable font family so if we include various styles of the same font we are going to get only one font file.
        - So, it is not going to increase the size of our html file.
        - Using object oriented CSS we can use any of the combination of different classes do make different versions of the same badge element.

        • CSS Sprites
        - Go to https://svgsprit.es/ to create a CSS sprite of svg files and then download sprite.
        - sprite.svg is like a text file. It is written using XML i.e. Extensible Markup Language.
        - It is also a markup language similar to HTML but the difference is HTML has some limited elements but XML is extensible.
        - We can create our custom elements in XML.
        - svg files have elements like svg, symbol, path, etc.
        - symbol element represents an icon.
        - For every icon, we can have more than one path. Path is like a curve that defines our icon.

        • Two types of approaches
        
        1. Bottom up: To build components first and then assemble them to build complex pages.
        - This approach is always preferred.

        2. Top down: To build page first and then add components.
        - This approach can be messy as we can have so many layout issues and solving them can take much longer time.
