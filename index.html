        <!--
        • Media Component or Media Object:
        - It is a component containing an image or an icon on the left side and a heading and some text on the right side.

        • Color Palette
        - It contains primary, secondary, accent and other colours.

        - Inter is a variable font family so if we include various styles of the same font we are going to get only one font file.
        - So, it is not going to increase the size of our html file.
        - Using object oriented CSS we can use any of the combination of different classes do make different versions of the same badge element.

        • CSS Sprites
        - Go to https://svgsprit.es/ to create a CSS sprite of svg files and then download sprite.
        - sprite.svg is like a text file. It is written using XML i.e. Extensible Markup Language.
        - It is also a markup language similar to HTML but the difference is HTML has some limited elements but XML is extensible.
        - We can create our custom elements in XML.
        - svg files have elements like svg, symbol, path, etc.
        - symbol element represents an icon.
        - For every icon, we can have more than one path. Path is like a curve that defines our icon.

        • Two types of approaches
        
        1. Bottom up: To build components first and then assemble them to build complex pages.
        - This approach is always preferred.

        2. Top down: To build page first and then add components.
        - This approach can be messy as we can have so many layout issues and solving them can take much longer time.

        • Quotes
        - In the quotes component, we should not add an image because it is possible that somewhere in an article on the page we do not need the image of the person.
        - So, a quote component should only contain the text, name of the person and name of the organisation.

        - To create a testimonial component, we will combine the quote component with the image and put it inside the card component.

        • Optimizing Images
        - We are providing an image which is over 1500px wide.
        - Our container is always constrained for 1140px and image will take half of its width i.e. 570px.
        - And on mobile it is taking 100% of the width which not more than 500px.
        - So, our image is always displayed for not more than 570px.

        • Problems:
        1. We are supplying a large sized-file even when it is not needed.
        2. Browser has to do resizing of the image which we do not want.

        • Solutions:
        1. We will serve a 570px wide image.
        2. Then, let the browser do small resizing (like 570px -> 500px)
        3. Also for high pixel density screen (retina display) we have to supply 2x and 3x versions of image.
            - 3x version will take 1710px and our image is of 1500px so to make it 3x, photoshop has to create some more pixels which never existed.
            - We are only going to provide 2x version.
