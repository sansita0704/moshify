        - On smaller screens, there is a layout issue.
        - To solve any type of layout issue, first we should isolate that component by deleting other elements in inspect tab.
        - Here, we gave a border to input group and input field to see things clearly.
        - Then, as we decreased the screen size, we saw that the input field has grown more than the container due to a default width applied by the browser.
        - To resolve this, we set the width of the input field to zero and then let the browser decide the width of the input field using flex grow property.

        - Also, we saw that the horizontal padding was larger for small devices dut to which the input field became smaller.
        - To solve this, we used 'vw' unit instead of 'rem'.
        - As a result, wider the screens are, larger is the horizontal padding of the button.

        - To solve the layout of the domain prices, we have to use a 2 column grid instead of a 3 column grid.
        - So, we have to do something different from our design mockup to make our website more responsive.

        - To change the color of the list items, we will add the color in the styling section of domain block because we had removed the color property from the list class.
